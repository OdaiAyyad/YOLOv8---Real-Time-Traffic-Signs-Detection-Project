üö¶ YOLOv8-Based Real-Time Object Detection System

Overview
This project leverages the YOLOv8 model to develop a real-time object detection system capable of identifying and classifying objects with high accuracy and speed.

Key Features
1Ô∏è‚É£ Model Performance:

Achieved 93% accuracy and processed frames at 15ms per frame, making it ideal for real-time applications.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Dataset Preparation:

Created a custom dataset with precise annotations for 15 object classes, ensuring compatibility with YOLOv8.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Real-Time Implementation:

Integrated with local hardware to enable webcam-based real-time detection, showcasing live object tracking during demonstrations.
4Ô∏è‚É£ Optimization:
